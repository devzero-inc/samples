**Database + Auth Service:** Our application leverages Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative that combines both database and authentication services. Supabase provides us with a PostgreSQL database for robust and relational data storage, along with secure and scalable user authentication.

**Backend + Frontend:** We've chosen Next.js for its seamless integration of frontend and backend capabilities, providing a cohesive development experience. This is complemented by Tailwind CSS for styling, offering a utility-first approach that enables rapid and responsive design implementations.
