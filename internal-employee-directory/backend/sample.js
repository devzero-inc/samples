(Which makes me, obviously, not a easy going person... You have to convince me that is a challenge... Sometimes is easy... sometimes not...). I'm not a person of musings and dreams. We have to do what we have to be done, and we have to make it awesome! A good co-worker and team member, exceptional quality is the least I can offer!",
